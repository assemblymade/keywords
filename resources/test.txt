coolnalu also said something in that conversation I saved, "When deciding whether to join a project what I care most is if the people have a track record of carrying things out :-)". Support for profiles showing earned emojis as well as the changelog itself (for product track record)
whoa he quit his full time
interesting discussion in general chat that in some ways seems like a request for the changes we're working on (specifically, loosening the definition of what it means to be an assembly product) http://cl.ly/image/3d183y2b1D2f/Screen%20Shot%202015-05-12%20at%209.34.34%20AM.png

WIP:
channel product tiiiiiiiiime
@elaine uploaded a file: nav to include going back to the feed and commented: super scrappy. The first one seems to be the easiest to implement. Option 1) Add &lt; View Log link inpage. Option 2) On mobile showpage the assembly logo disappears and gets replaced with a back button. Drawback is that the global menu can't be accessed until back to the list view (yagni?) Option 3) Same as 2, but using the generic title Changelog instead of [company] changelog Option 4) using company logo in the nav...not working so well Option 5) adding back link in the nav on mobile.  A lot of stuff here. I can speak through it

try it @elaine
what if when i type "hahaha" an random gif generates and post for me
@elaine: its well known in engineering circles
hahaha
you could, but yagni
PRO TIP: good interview question; if a developer doesn’t know what YAGNI is, I’d seriously doubt their talents
can i use that word outside of Assembly
probably more like 99/100
because 9/10 times the future doesn’t play out the way you thought it would
like; don’t build more then you need
ah
"you aint going to need it"
worrying too much about a pattern
yagni is what?
yagni on what?
but i guess yagni on that
i think as long as that’s a pattern we use for other things we have there it’s :+1:

hi, can someone hook me up as an assembly staff please :simple_smile: https://assembly.com/users/elainelylee
I think it’s all right ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
:metal: :qris: :metal:
Should we be sanitizing that out or leaving it in for a handful only (like Chris’s post about deploying titan)?
channel i’m cleaning up all the stories currently on Changelog (formatting, adding in contributors, etc). How do we feel about sharing externally the name “Titan”?
so maybe it's ok?
well, the image / gif upload isn't really inline when presented in the comment
yeah
i think that’s the behavior we have here — we’re adding an image to the comment
yeah, like it feels less inline
with the emoji button in the textarea, i add an emoji to my comment
i add a file
like, with slack, when i click the arrow, i don’t add a comment
i think when it takes over the whole box, it feels like i’m adding something else to the conversation
i meant on the left
@elaine uploaded a file: Pasted image at 2015-05-11, 2:48 PM and commented: on the right, tho this interaction may encourage the user to upload something more. what do you think?
except for the icon
Better!
@elaine uploaded a file: Pasted image at 2015-05-11, 2:47 PM and commented: camera icon on the right
@mdeiters: though the icons look nicer without the circle or square, without them makes the emoji feel like just a flat icon (mainly because we're not styling them as empty vs selected). So we need some other cue to show the user that you should touch this.
@elaine uploaded a file: Screen Shot 2015-05-11 at 2.36.16 PM.png and commented: it'll look like this if you're writing a lot
nope
are we expecting files other than photos

whoooooaaaaaaa, for real @mdeiters? I can’t stand that box

and I actually like the comment box — I think it’ll be clearer what the grayed-out row does with more icons and with changing the file to a camera
Hey everyone i’m with @awwstn - the meta approach is superior to anything else so far, why not re-use the wheel instead of create a new one
I’m digging the orange
@elaine: I like the middle-right one, but the bottom-left one feels most clickable to me
it’s right at the start of the level
http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view2/1383780/rainbow-road-jump-o.gif
beautifully done
ah, beat me to it
/giphy rainbow road shortcut
@elaine uploaded a file: emoji labels and commented: purpose of this exploration is to make the emoji feel more actionable. how are these so far? (btw, they're all separate default states, one isn't the hover state for the other). In addition, there are small tweaks to the designs. One has a light background that breaks up the comment section
oh man
/giphy rainbow road
/giphy space
yeah
so much space
the meta approach here isn't bad imo http://cl.ly/image/0A2o0n3j363G/Screen%20Shot%202015-05-11%20at%202.25.00%20PM.png
:boom: :musical_note:
hm, or more svbtle, like @awwstn suggested
yes
:metal: :qris: :metal:
does chris get a appraise every time we mention his name haha
yeah slackbot agrees with me
:metal: :qris: :metal:
maybe it needs to be more subtle, or place it on the right of the field like chris suggested
i actually think i should click into the grey box, as if the white box is the label
i look at the grey box more then the text box
it takes up alot of visual real estate for a little icon on the right
~
^ that’s cool; it gives us space to add more icons later on too
ignore the image icon
@elaine uploaded a file: Pasted image at 2015-05-11, 2:18 PM and commented: not sure if this works, but something like this to help tie the icon back in with the text field
this needs to exist: bugreportsfrom12yearolds.tumblr.com
/giphy gross
@mdeiters: yeah working on text-underline
ohhh
yep
ah, but @chrislloyd, in your version it’s still in the textarea, no?
text-underline in general looks jacked
it can insert files, they just won’t show up very well
(can insert files etc.)
i think we could move to + when that thing is more flexible
ok
it inserts an image, + doesn’t tell you that
potentially
but so overloading the + is confusing
(j/k j/k)
no gifs
where do gifs go
:disappointed: I spent so much time on that :troll:
why not a plus?
already going up

lemmie have a look at it
it’s off by like, 4px on mobile
blergh
“Changelog” should be directly over top of the green logo
oh, wait — it’s not centered on mobile either
@chrislloyd: does that ^ sound like the right approach?
so that we can center everything independently
I guess we could have the title portion extend the entire way across the page behind the logo and the avatar
@pletcher uploaded a file: And it’s fine on mobile
it’s going to be tough to pull “Changelog” to the left a bit
they’re both non-centered
yeah the non-centered version is gratting
(I was trying to absolutely center “Changelog” — it’s getting bumped to the right by “Assembly” — and accidentally popped things out of vertical alignment)
@pletcher uploaded a file: Fixed:
(that’s the joke)
it’s an interesting effect

Okay
not name, we’re not changing the company name :stuck_out_tongue:
*nav
but the name is still very much up in the air
no, our name
“Assembly” in the upper-left: will that be the organization’s name?
*fixed
yeah that’s in my version
@mdeiters uploaded a file: can we have gifs/images line break?
ok cool
re: link colors. Was testing out using orange as the link color. wanna roll that out for the list view as well (instead of blue)
:+1:
next workacation: NYC or Upstate, so we can go to Dia Beacon (http://www.diaart.org/) for Sol Lewitt
mmhm, was just amending my previously less helpful bug report
or something, to break out of the flow
needs to be set as absolute
yep
@pletcher uploaded a file: The reason “Changelog” looks off-center is because “Assembly” + the flag is wider than the avatar; it’s fixed at narrower widths since “Assembly” goes away

@pletcher:  i thought talking about stuff was the solution
@pletcher:  +1 to moving comment box to bottom of thread
but what is the solution?
http://cl.ly/image/0a1A2y2N0g0h
I know, I was there :simple_smile:
yeah, that bug was brought up at standup
yeah, I mean, that’s what prompted me to ask — what are we putting in the title instead?
@pletcher uploaded a file: Screen Shot 2015-05-11 at 11.19.06 AM.png
identical to titanic but didn't sink
could call it RMS Olympic
nobody is actually seeing the titan name
zlack bitcoin
We could also maybe change the name to Titian, which I’ve accidentally typed more than once
zlack, are you alive?

but of course Helene launched a thousand ships
(although I guess that’d require us switching planets)
If we want to stick with moons, Io is great and punny
Titan is a lame name
+1 pletcher
that can be rebranded in the future
it feels like a good, silly first pass at a proper (memorable) name
I haven’t been entirely joking with the HyperChangelogBlog suggestion
This is going to launch a firestorm, but what should we actually call Titan?
I tend to agree with @elaine — the bottom positioning feels much less intrusive
@pletcher uploaded a file: Screen Shot 2015-05-11 at 10.43.32 AM.png
regarding emoji, agree with having the number count on it. on friday we briefly chatted about designing them more like an empty / filled state just like the hearts (2nd iteration perhaps)
@pletcher uploaded a file: Screen Shot 2015-05-11 at 10.42.23 AM.png
I see, that sounds good. for the placement, it may be better to have it on the bottom so it follows the user. the user doesn't need to scroll back up to upload an emoji / gif
(slack does it pretty well)
text will overlap the icons wether they’re on the top or the bottom, unless the actual textarea is a little short
but the physical textarea element is slightly shorter
visually
still inside the textarea
so you never get weird issues of text being under the icon
so you want it outside of the textarea, not overlapping it?

@pletcher uploaded a file: Screen Shot 2015-05-11 at 10.38.01 AM.png
`mr1` also feels a bit wide:
2s, diagramming
wait, I don’t think I follow @chrislloyd — that feels confusing
i imagined the actual textbox being a little shorter
oh actually, that’s why i was saying top right
prefer the bottom corner, so if the user was writing they the UI element wouldn't be lost on the top
maybe `mt1 mr1`?
(“1… or 2?”


“3… or 4?”)
zlack wow eye doctor
or worse?
@pletcher uploaded a file: better?

top right then :+1:
